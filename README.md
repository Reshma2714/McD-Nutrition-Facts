### 🎯 Problem Statement

Fast food is often associated with poor nutrition, but the actual nutrient distribution across items and categories is not always obvious. The key problems this project addresses are:

- **Which categories contribute most to calorie and fat intake?**
- **How do items vary in terms of sugar, sodium, and cholesterol?**
- **Which category is the most nutrient-dense or healthiest?**
- **What’s the distribution of food items across categories?**

### 💡 Objectives

- Visualize and compare key nutritional elements by food category.
- Identify high-risk categories (e.g., high sodium or sugar).
- Enable informed food choices for consumers and nutritionists.
